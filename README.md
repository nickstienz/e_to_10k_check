# E to 10k Check

This program reads from a file called check.txt to see
if every words length is a digit of e in order.

## Usage

1. Create a check.txt in the same dir as the program (e_to_10k_check)
2. Paste your text into the check.txt file and save
3. Run e_to_10k_check through a terminal

## Other

Most of this code was ChatGPT and I'm not looking
over it since it works. Use at your own risk!
